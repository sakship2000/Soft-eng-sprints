This repository contains two projects from my Software Engineering class. 
1) System Requirement Specification of a Co-op support application which was assigned to help us get a better idea of the Agile Methodology.

2) Hogwarts Hobo Game - a modified version of the famous Frogger game. Creating this game with a group of people helped me understand how employees undergo software engineering process in the workplace.

Hogwart Hobo files:
HogwartsHobo.java
    -Source code of the game 
StdDraw.java (downloaded and slightly modified)

Product Backlog.pdf
    -Includes the Product Backlog, Test Plan, and Results Report

Group member contributions:
All group members contributed equally to this project. As a team, we decided it was best to split the implementation
into five parts (one for each group member):
    Score Counter/Timer
    Trains/Tracks
    Magical Hobo paper plane hints
    Health Bar
    Hobo Character/Visuals 
Each member was responsible for their respective source code, their sprint details and thier own testing. All group members
help up their parts and helped one another throughout the process. The product backlog, the test plan and the results report were 
collaborative.
